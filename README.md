# BashWebExplanatory
This repository is dedicated to the development of a German-language website aimed at providing fundamental explanations of Bash scripting, focusing on core concepts.

We extend our sincere gratitude to the following individuals for their significant contributions in the form of information gathering, examples, and, in some cases, the conversion of these elements into code based on templates:
